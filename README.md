# IoUF - for a better tomorrow
IoUF stands for Internet of Urban Farms. This project is a technical solution for optimising yield in agricultural farms and an approach to bring the idea of a smart urban farms into reality. Deep Learning for Pest Control,IOT and cloud technologies for storing sensor data and automating irrigation pumps have been implemented.
Codes and their functionalities :
*raspberrypi_farm.py is the main automation script(MCU)main control unit,also for early pest detection and disease detection.
*farm_remote_controller.ino code does the controlling of drip irrigation, pump actuation from an isolated site,RCU(remote control unit)
*farm_arduino.ino code does the various sensor interface and acts as a SCU(supporting control unit)
(RCU) remote control unit.
