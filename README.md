# IoUF - for a better tomorrow
IoUF stands for Internet of Urban Farms. This project is a technical solution for optimising yield in agricultural farms and an approach to bring the idea of a smart urban farms into reality. Deep Learning for Pest Control,IOT and cloud technologies for storing sensor data and automating irrigation pumps have been implemented.</br>
Codes and their functionalities :</br>
*raspberrypi_farm.py is the main automation script(MCU)main control unit,also for early pest detection and disease detection.</br>
*farm_remote_controller.ino code does the controlling of drip irrigation, pump actuation from an isolated site,RCU(remote control unit)</br>
*farm_arduino.ino code does the various sensor interface and acts as a SCU(supporting control unit)
(RCU) remote control unit.</br>
